[MakeBackbufferAttachable]
help="Alters the size specification of the created backbuffer so that it copes with the actual primary surface and that it may be attached to a ZBUFFER surface. It makes "Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX" playable."
[BlitFromBackbuffer]
help="Some games ("The Sims", the only one so far...) read graphic data from the primary surface. When the game runs windowed, the approximation introduced in a scaled window brings cumulative error that appear as a progressive smearing effect. In this case, it might be better to read the data from the backbuffer surface that is not scaled, even if in such a way you get other troubles when scrolling (see it by yourself...). The only reasonable alternative: Write game code in a better way, in my opinion!"
[NoSystemMemoryOnPrimary]
help="DirectDraw applications have much better performance if they can operate on system memory rather than video memory, particularly when reading surface memory. Since the virtual primary surface has to be read before it can be transferred to the actual primary surface, it's best to use system memory offscreen surfaces whenever possible. Unfortunately, some programs request hardware acceleration functions that are only available for video surfaces. This flag forces the virtual primary surface to be created in system memory, sacrificing performance for compatibility."
[NoSystemMemoryOnBackbuffer]
help="Similar to the NoSystemMemoryOnPrimary tweak, but applied to the backbuffer surface. It's rare to need both of these flags, and the one to be used depends on where the application performs the accelerated functions."

[FixParentWindow]
help="Typically, a game is started with an invisible program window, and then it creates a separate child window for handling the graphics. Some games use the parent window instead of the child window. In this case, the parent window becomes visible and then needs to be properly resized. This feature is currently experimental, but it seems to successfully manage several tough games, such as "Solaris", "Sleepwalker", "Sid Meier's SimGolf", and the Worms series."
[MouseMoveByEvent]

help="On Windows 10, all Direct3D8 fullscreen applications always run in fake fullscreen mode by default, which is also known as maximized windowed mode. This was done for compatibility with Game Bar, whose interface doesn't show otherwise. This tweak alters a setting in Direct3D8 runtime DLL (d3d8.dll) to restore real exclusive fullscreen mode. Additionally, it disables compatibility shim for turning on maximized windowed mode. This shim also exists in Windows 8.x and is responsible for making certain games run in maximized windowed mode by default on that OS as well. This mode is not implemented on Windows 7 and earlier, so the tweak doesn't apply to those systems. Starting with Windows 10 October 2018 Update, exclusive fullscreen functionality has been removed from Direct3D8 runtime, rendering this tweak ineffective."

[SAFEHEAP]
help="A tentative fix for heap operations. Each heap allocation is wrapped with begin/end markers and a length field so that it becomes possible to check for heap integrity and skip operations that may lead to exceptions. Unfortunately, it is not possible to wrap all memory segments (some are pre-allocated before DxWnd hook) so in some cases, the integrity checks inevitably fail. In any case, it seems to give some benefit. It must be used with early hooking only."
[SPONGEBOBHACK]
help="Eliminates the 16-bit pure white color (0xFFFF) from SpongeBob textures. The 0xFFFF value in textures is mapped as a transparent color, so it is replaced by a color close enough: 0xF7FF. So far, it used in "SpongeBob SquarePants: Employee of the Month" only."

[SlowDownExceptions]
help="Despite the best efforts of the "Handle Exceptions" flag, some exceptions gets repeated very quickly. This tweak forces a small delay (a few mSec) after the exception detection so that the event doesn't get too frequent. In the game "MechWarrior 2" the tweak may help to set a more correct time handling."
[SlowCDStatus]
help="Some games poll the CD status in a tight loop that executes the MCI commands very frequently, probably supposing that the operation would require some time and delay. Using CD audio emulation, the operation can become very fast as the status request is done too frequently, consuming CPU resources and possibly interfering with the CD play activity. The tweak forces a delay within the CD status request to make the operation less frequent.

[LimitResources]
help="Causes the query for available resources (RAM, hard disk space, etc.) to return a limited value: some old games can't handle a very big integer number and see it as a negative value, refusing to start. It should be used with early hooking only. Usually games that need this flag crash immediately at the start complaining about the lack of memory. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, "Dungeon Keeper" crashes randomly while playing the game if this flag is not enabled."	
[ReplacePrivOpcodes]
help="Real multitasking OSes (starting from Windows NT) forbid applications from using privileged instructions that directly manipulate the hardware, like the IN opcode. Running a program with such opcodes will result in a program exception on modern systems. This option scans the program code segment at startup and replaces all the detected privileged operations with NOP (no operation) instructions. Since these opcodes are often dedicated to interactions with the sound hardware, the program will likely work with the possible side effect of some audio issues.

[TrimChildWindows]
help="A child window created outside the parent area and with trim options could easily become invisible and unreached by mouse events, as if it didn't exist. The tweak checks the child window coordinates and, when necessary, moves them so that the child window is always inside the parent area. This tweak can fix the disappeared in-game menus of "Amy's Fantasies"."
[TrimMainWindow]
help="The tweak trims the position and size of a window so that its position is always inside the desktop area. Some games uses the possibility to set huge coordinates to create a fulscreen window, but on recent OS this can impact on other operations. The tweak fixes the "Need for Speed SE" crash because it creates a window whose declared size is 10000x10000!"
