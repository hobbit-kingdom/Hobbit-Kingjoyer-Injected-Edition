This folder holds proxy dll files that are meant to be installed using the Dxwnd GUI. 
(Right click on the game entry and select Proxy> and the desired option.)

See "The Interface" -> "Program List" in Dxwnd help files.

Beware!

The proxy dlls triggers the suspicions of many AV software making it impossible to 
freely distribute them. For this reason all the proxy dll files were stored into the cyphered
proxy.rar file, password protected with password "proxy".
This way the AV can't access its content and block the transfer.
Be aware that in case you may want to use the proxy files the archive will have to be decompressed
on its current folder, but the operation could easily wake up the AV detection.
If that happens it is a false positive, but you don't have to believe me, you can inspect the
source code, build the proxies by yourself or you may forget about it.
